# citrus scheme

citrus scheme is a toy scheme interpreter written in Java.

## Building

To build the interpreter, be sure to have a jdk installed like openjdk7.

```
./gradlew installDist
```

This will build the interpreter and create the script and jars necessary 
for running the interpreter at `build/install/`.
